1. Disconnect the spark plug cap, and remove any dirt from around the spark plug area.
2. Remove the spark plug with a 13/16-inch spark plug wrench.
3. Inspect the spark plug. Replace it if the electrodes are worn or if the insulator is cracked or chipped. Clean the spark plug with a wire brush if you are going to reuse it.
4. Measure the spark plug electrode gap with a suitable gauge. The gap should be 0.028–0.031 in (0.70–0.80 mm). Correct the gap, if necessary, by carefully bending the side electrode.
5. Install the spark plug carefully, by hand, to avoid cross-threading.
6. After the spark plug seats, tighten with a 13/16-inch spark plug
wrench to compress the washer. If reinstalling the used spark plug, tighten 1/8 1/4 turn after the
spark plug seats. If installing a new spark plug, tighten 1/2 turn after the spark plug
seats.
7. Attach the spark plug cap
